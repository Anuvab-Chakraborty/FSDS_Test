=======What is data structure?===========

Data structure are different ways to organize data in your computer,to work more efficiently.
Real life example of data structure is a queue where if we want to buy tickets we need to form a line and
it works on the basis of first in first out principle.

===================explain different types of data structure=======================

There are two types of data structures.Primitive or Inbuilt  data structures and non primitive or user defined
data structures.
The primitive data structures are Integer,Boolean,Float,String,Character.
The built in data structures in python are List,set,tuples,dictionary.
and the non primitive data structures are stack,queue,linkedlist,tree,graph.

===========what is a list in python=============

A list in python is defined by [] and it is one of the four builtin data structure in
python. It is a mutable ordered collection of items.It can store any type of data
whether its an integer or string inside them.

Lists increases productivity.
List are really flexible.

============what is tuple in python?==============

A tuple is defined by () and it is one of the 4 builtin data structures in python.
It is an immutable ordered collection of items which we cannot change after defining
them.It can store any type of datawhether its an integer or string inside them.

Tuples are fine sized and faster than lists.
It can be very efficient when we have a predefined set of values.
It is easy to search values in tuples.

============what is dictionary in python?==========

A dictionary is defined by {} and it is a collection of items which is
unordered and changeable and indexed key value pair.

It improves the readibility of the code.
It makes the programme more time and space efficient.

==========what is linked list in python==========
A linked list a form of sequential collection of elements and it does not
have to be in order.Each node of the linked list can contain any type of values and
each node of the linked list holds the reference to the next of the linked list.
It is a linear data structure.
It is a dynamic data structure and using it stops wastage of memory

============what is stack in python===========

A stack is a linear data structure that stores data in the last in first out manner.
In stack the insert and deletion operations are often called as push and pop.
A real life example of stack is a pile of dinner plates,the last placed dinner
plate is taken out first.
The advantages of stack is it is easy to implement.
The memory is easy to allocate and deallocate.
Stacks are used to solve problems that works in recursion.

===========what is queue in python?==========

A queue is a linear data structure that stores data in the first in first out 
manner.In queue the insert and delete functions are often called as enqueue
and dequeue.A real life example of queue is the line for the ticket of anything.
the first one in the line gets more priority.
By using queue multiple data can be handled and they are fast and also flexible.

==============What is Tree in python============

A tree is a non-linear data structure in which a root node is present,all the 
other nodes than that is connected to a parent node.Tree represents the nodes
that are connected by edges.

It is a flexible way to hold and move data.
It is a hierarchial way to hold data.
Insertion and deletion operations are faster than linked list and lists.

=============what is Graph in python============

The graph consists of a finite set of vertices and a set of edges
which connects a pair of nodes.

graph algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a map.
Its main advantage is it makes it easy to work with large amount of data.
They are also very effective visual tools. 

=========What is an array in python?==========

An array in python is collection of items with common type of data structures
having elements of same data type.It is a mutable data structure.

Arrays are more perfect for arithmatic operations.

=============What is the difference between arrays and python lists=======

Lists are more flexible Arrays are not that flexible.
Lists can consist of different data types . Arrays only consists of the
same datatype
Large chunk of memory required ,Arrays are more compact in size.
Cannot perform Arithmatic operations easily.Can perform arithmatic operations
easily.
Preferred for short sequence of data.Preferred for long sequence of data. 

===============What is the difference between Lists and Tuples===========

Lists are Mutable || Tuples are Immutable.
Iterating through a list is more time consuming. || Iterating through a
tuple is less time consuming
List consumes a lot of memory || Tuples consume a lot less memory.

===========What is the difference between Lists and Dictionary==========
In Lists the values are accesed via INDEX || In dictionary searching is done 
using Keys.
Lists are ordered || Dictionaries are unordered.
Lists allows duplicates || Dictionary does'nt allow duplicates.
Preferred for ordered data || Preferred for unique Key value pair datas.

=============Difference between List and Linked list==============\

In list data is stored in a contigious way so inserting a data can lead to
other data being overridden.  || In linked list data is stored in non-contigious 
memory locations so it is more dynamic.

Elements of linked list are independent objects. || Elements of list arent.

The size of linked list is not predefined.

Insertion and deletion operations are very efficient.
