=======What do you mean by sdlc?============

In software engineering SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

========What are the different stages of sdlc?==========

There are 7 stages of Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning stage.
2.Analysis Stage.
3.Design Stage.
4.Development Stage.
5.Testing Stage.
6.Integration Stage.
7.Maintenance stage.

=======Name some sdlc models=======

Some of the most famous sdlc models are :
Agile 
Waterfall
Lean
DevOps.
Iterative
Spiral

======explain one sdlc model=============

The agile model is based on adaptive software development
Methods.It believes every project should be handled in
separate methods.And the Existing methods should be
tailored for the best suit of the projects.
Agile model does not use the traditional predictive
approaches.Instead it uses adaptive approach.
In agile method there is no detailed planning stage,
instead there is clarity on future tasks about which
features needed to be developed.
It uses the iterative approache where each phase
consists with :
planning->Requirement analysis->
Designing->Building->Testing and then after the 
first iteration the process is continued again.


The advantages of Agile model:
It is a very realistic approach to software dev.
Promotes teamwork and cross training.
Resource requirements are minimum.
Suitable for both fixed and changing requirements.
Delivers early partial working solutions.
Minimal rules,documentation easily employed.
East to manage.

The disadvantages of Agile model:
More risks of sustainability,maintainability
Depends heavily on customer interaction,if the
customer is not clear the team maybe driven in the 
wrong direction.
There is a very high individual dependency,since
there is minimum documentation.
Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.

===============================================

=====Explain waterfall model================

The waterfall model was the first software development
model which was introduce.It is known as linear sequencial
life cycle model.Here the next phase begins only
when the first phase is over.
It consists of the following stages:
#Requirement gathering and analysis : All the requirements
of the system to be developed are captured and 
documented is a requirement document.
#System Design : The requirement specifications from
first phase are studied and the design is prepared.
#Implementation: With inputs from system design the
system is first developed and tested in small 
programs called units.
#Integration and Testing: After all the testing the
small units are integrated into a system.And then
the full system is tested.
#deployment: Once the testing is done the product
is deployed in the customer environment or released
into the market.
#maintenance: There are some issues that may come 
up in the client environment to resolve them patches
are released.

The advantages of waterfall model is that:

It is simple to understand and use.
It is easy to manage.
Phases are processed and completed one at a time.
Works well for smaller projects.
Well understood milestones
Easy to arrange tasks.

Disadvantages:
High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
No working software is produced until late 
during the life cycle.
Not a good model for complex object oriented projects.
Poor for long and ongoing projects.

=========================================

=====difference between agile and waterfall models====

Agile divides the projects into small sprints || 
Waterfall model divides the project into distinct 
phases.
Agile follows an incremental approach || Waterfall
follows a sequential approach.
Agile is more flexible. || Waterfall is rigid

Test plan in agile is reviewed frequently|| Test 
plan is reviewed rarely.

Agile is linked to customer ideas deeply. || 
Waterfall is not dependent upon customers idea that much.
